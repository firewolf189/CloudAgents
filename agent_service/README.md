# Agent Service

Agent service is a FastAPI-based, multi-tenant and multi-session service built with AgentScope 2.0.

This example demonstrates

- how to set up the agent service with Redis storage, and
- how to launch the service and its companion Web UI

Details about the agent service please refer to the [tutorial](https://docs.agentscope.io/v2/deploy/agent-service).

## Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.11
- Node.js ≥ 20 with `npx`
- [optional] Gaode/AMap API key in `AMAP_API_KEY` (for the `amap` MCP)

## Quickstart

Install AgentScope from PyPI or source:

```bash
uv pip install agentscope[full]
# or
# uv pip install -e [full]
```

Install Redis and start it as backend storage:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Linux (systemd)
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# Docker (cross-platform)
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis:7
```

Start the agent service:

```bash
cd agent_service

python main.py
```
